# Vim You, Autocorrect!

*Why should smartphones get all the fun?*

Find Vim's commands for correcting spelling mistakes UNWIELDLY? Long for a
solution that approaches the EASE-OF-USE and FOOLPROOF SOPHISTICATION of your
phone's autocorrect mechanism?

Look no further!

Vim You, Autocorrect, HARNESSES the power of Vim's `'spell'` option,
AUTOMATICALLY replacing spelling mistakes and typoes as you type.

Just install in the usual way&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;manually or with your
favourite plugin manager&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;and marvel at the BLEMISH-FREE
prose that FLOWS onto your screen as your fingers DANCE over the keycaps.
