# Vim You, Autocorrect!

*Why should smartphones get all the fun?*

## UPDATE!!! New Version!

*Hot off the presses!*

Vim 1.1 adds NEW FEATURES, finally allowing you to enter INCORRECT and LESS
CORRECT words into your screenplay. LEAP back to corrected words. UNDO
corrections, restoring your typos to their former glory. SKIP through Vim's
suggested spellings with simple USER CONFIGURABLE mappings. HIGHLIGHT the
latest correction to be reminded how often this plugin has saved you from
embarrassing yourself with your preschool-level understanding of how words are
spelled.

See [`:help autocorrect-advanced-configuration`](https://github.com/sedm0784/vim-you-autocorrect/blob/d20e80b204db91f9aa65f1ff81d4cbf60b8cc470/doc/vim-you-autocorrect.txt#L81) for more details.

## Original Blurb

Find Vim&rsquo;s commands for correcting spelling mistakes UNWIELDLY? Long for a
solution that approaches the EASE-OF-USE and FOOLPROOF SOPHISTICATION of your
phone&rsquo;s autocorrect mechanism?

Look no further!
