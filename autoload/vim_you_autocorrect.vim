  " spelling error behind the cursor on this line or the previous one.

  " Vim You, Autocorrect! would decline to correct it anyway, reasoning that
  " it cannot just have been typed if it's over a line away.

  " for 'scrolloff'), they cannot possibly just have hit enter (because then
  " their cursor would have moved one screen line line lower down, so we
  " *don't* want to scroll to any errors in the line immediately above.
  "
  " Note seriously for the last time that if there is an error at the start
  " of a very long soft-wrapped line, and that error is off-screen, then the
  " entire line must be off-screen, because of the way Vim will never display
