==============================================================================
1. Introduction                                     *autocorrect-introduction*

Vim You, Autocorrect! releases you from the DRUDGERY of having to correct your
spelling mistakes and typos by automatically accepting Vim's suggestions for
each misspelled word as you type.

==============================================================================
2. Usage                                                   *autocorrect-usage*

Simply switch Vim You, Autocorrect! on by typing |:EnableAutocorrect|, and
never have to worry about spelling errors again!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Commands                                            *autocorrect-commands*

                                              *autocorrect-:EnableAutocorrect*
:EnableAutocorrect
               This turns on Vim You, Autocorrect! for the current buffer. Most
               likely you will want to enable autocorrections globally by
               adding something like the following to your .vimrc file:
>
               augroup ILoveCorrections
                 autocmd!
                 autocmd BufEnter * EnableAutocorrect
               augroup END
<
                                             *autocorrect-:DisableAutocorrect*
:DisableAutocorrect
               This turns Vim You, Autocorrect! off again. You will probably
               never want to do this I don't know why I implemented it.

==============================================================================
3. How Does It Work?                            *autocorrect-how-does-it-work*

Vim You, Autocorrect! has a very sophisticated and subtle mechanism. The full
details of how it works are almost impossible to explain, but essentially it
does something like the following:

   1. As you finish typing each word, Vim You, Autocorrect! issues a   `[s`
      motion command,
   2. If a spelling error is detected, Vim You, Autocorrect! issues a   `1z=`
      command to accept the first spelling suggestion.

==============================================================================
4. Advanced Configuration                               *autocorrect-mappings*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Highlighting                                    *autocorrect-highlighting*

Vim You, Autocorrect! adds a new |highlight| group, which is used to highlight
the most recent correction for a short period of time.

                                              *autocorrect-hl-AutocorrectGood*
AutocorrectGood
                The most recently corrected word. By default, this simply
                links to your current |hl-SpellBad| highlight group (because
                otherwise, you might get sad because you never get to see that
                colour). If you want to define your own highlighting instead,
                add a line such as the following to your |vimrc|:
>
                highlight AutocorrectGood ctermfg=Red guifg=Red gui=undercurl
<
If you set a |colorscheme| in your |vimrc|, ensure that you do so BEFORE
setting your |AutocorrectGood| highlight: some colorschemes will clear
existing highlighting when they are set. Alternatively, use a |ColorScheme|
autocommand; this is the mechanism Vim provides for ensuring specified
highlights are always respected.

                                *'g:vim_you_autocorrect_disable_highlighting'*
'g:vim_you_autocorrect_disable_highlighting'
                        boolean (default off)
                        global
                To disable highlighting entirely, add the following option to
                your |vimrc|:
>
                let g:vim_you_autocorrect_disable_highlighting = 1
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 Mappings

Version 1.0 of Vim You, Autocorrect! ensures that everything you type is
spelled CORRECTLY. However, subsequent to its release, I have been informed
that some users occasionally want to include words that are spelled
INCORRECTLY or LESS correctly in the things they write. Why do they want
this? It is a mystery to modern science.

Nevertheless, I am nothing if not ACCOMMODATING: I have prepared a number of
features to facilitate this unusual request. Vim You, Autocorrect! does not
add any mappings by default, that would be RUDE, but it provides a number of
internal mappings you can map to in your |vimrc|. (See |using-<Plug>|.)

                                                            *autocorrect-undo*
<Plug>VimyouautocorrectUndo
                Undo the most recent correction, returning the word to its
                originally typed (incorrect) spelling. e.g. Add this mapping
                to your |vimrc| to invoke this feature by typing   |<Leader>|u
                in normal mode:
>
                nmap <Leader>u <Plug>VimyouautocorrectUndo
<
                Or add this mapping to undo corrections by pressing   <F3>
                in insert mode:
>
                imap <F3> <C-O><Plug>VimyouautocorrectUndo
<
                                                            *autocorrect-jump*
<Plug>VimyouautocorrectJump
                Position cursor at the start of the most recent
                correction. e.g. To override the default behaviour of   |[s|
                (Because, hey, you're not using that now anyway, are you?) and
                use it instead to jump back to the last correction,
                add the following mapping to your |vimrc|:
>
                nmap [s <Plug>VimyouautocorrectJump
<
                Or to jump back and open Vim's regular interface for selecting
                a spelling correction by typing   |z=|   (You're not using
                that any more, either, right?) try this mapping:
>
                nmap z= <Plug>VimyouautocorrectJump<Plug>VimyouautocorrectUndo:call feedkeys('z=', 'n')<CR>
<
                                                            *autocorrect-next*
<Plug>VimyouautocorrectNext
                For the most recent correction, select the next of Vim's
                suggested corrections.

                                                        *autocorrect-previous*
<Plug>VimyouautocorrectPrevious
                For the most recent correction, select the previous of Vim's
                suggested corrections.

These commands allow you to step through Vim's list of spelling suggestions.
e.g. to set up   |]s|   and   |[s|   to iterate forwards and backwards through
Vim's list of suggestions, use the following normal mode mappings:
>
                nmap ]s <Plug>VimyouautocorrectNext
                nmap [s <Plug>VimyouautocorrectPrevious
<
Or if you don't want to exit insert mode, try these mappings:
>
                imap <F4> <C-O><Plug>VimyouautocorrectPrevious
                imap <F5> <C-O><Plug>VimyouautocorrectNext
<
Wait, I thought of a reason you might want to do this! Maybe you are QUOTING
text from elsewhere, and you need to preserve the INCORRECT spelling rather
than MISQUOTE the source. Perhaps a future version of Vim You, Autocorrect!
will add a feature to append [sic] to the text whenever you invoke the
VimyouautocorrectUndo mapping.
